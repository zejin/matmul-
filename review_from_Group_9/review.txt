Summary - Group 12
-------
Wow, you guys tried a lot. The change in the loop ordering was a good choice. By any chance, did you try the other combinations of orderings (e.g. jik, kji, etc.)? I know that the Fortran implementation uses the one that you tried, but you might want to add more intuition as to why the ordering works for the final version?

Also, good catch with the conflict misses, and very clever way of handling it. 

In the hierarchical blocking section, another group got a different number for the L1 cache than your group did. Is it 32 or 64? I followed the link you used and noticed that there are two 32s, so I thought it was 64.
