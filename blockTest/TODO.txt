1. transpose within blocking
  aa is a tranposed block matrix of A

2. vectorize (same as blocking with order j-k-i)
  before:
  for j
    for k
      for i
        C[i,j] += A[i,k] * B[k,j]
  after:
  for j
    for k
      C[:,j] += A[:,k] * B[k,j]

3. small size
  compute inner loop with order j-k-i
  no blocking is taken
